# Todo-List Project

This is a Todo-List project built using ReactJS and pure CSS. The project allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks in a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can easily create new tasks by typing the task name and pressing Enter or clicking the "Add Task" button.

- **Task Management**: Each task in the list can be managed with the following actions:
  - Marking a task as complete or incomplete
  - Editing a task name
  - Deleting a task

- **Persistence**: The project utilizes the browser's local storage to persist the task data. This means that even if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the browser, their tasks will be saved and restored.
